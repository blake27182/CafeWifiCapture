# CafeWifiCapture

Imagine you are in a crowded coffee shop and you're ready to pay for your order. After paying you ask for the wifi, and the cashier gestures to a small blackboard easel on the counter. You open this app, take a picture, and you are instantly logged in to the correct network, and the credentials are saved in your phones network settings.
